CFR: Calendar for Requirements

Problem Statement:
Having to meet the demands of the curriculum these days is not easy. Students struggle with the sheer amount of assignments and requirements that feel like they are being given every second. Relying solely on the people around you to remind you of the requirements is not enough, it is inconsistent; and you can not always trust them. No student is perfect, people forget, and that is human nature; it feels like only a constant reminder will solve this problem.

Project Objectives:
- Provide a constant reminder to users through device notifications.
- Help with organization of tasks/requirements by using an input and sorting them by date.
- Improve time management measured through amount of requirements/ tasks done before the deadline.

Planned Features:
- Calendar-type interface
  -A page for each month, containing rectangles for each day of the month. The user can input an event for each day.
- Notification system
  -This feature will send a notification in time periods the user will input. For example: if user inputs 7:00 P.M for every day until the deadline, a notification will be sent at the exact time.
- Light/Dark mode
  -This can change the theme of the GUI between dark to light.
- Daily to-do list
  -This feature provides the user with the freedom to create their own checklist everyday. This will also work with the notification system. The user can input tasks everyday and will be notified every few hours depending on the input of the user.

Input/Output
- User will input a requirement into a box of the calendar
  - Program is expected to save the data and project on the box

- User will input a time for everyday before a deadline
  - Program is expected to output a notification everyday at that time before the deadline

-User will choose between light/dark mode via switch
  - Program is expected to change theme

- User will input a list of tasks in a checkbox tab

  - Program is expected to output the time before the day ends and display the tasks on a checkbox list
