CFR: Calendar for Requirements

Problem Statement:
Having to meet the demands of the curriculum these days is not easy. Students struggle with the sheer amount of assignments and requirements that feel like they are being given every second. Relying solely on the people around you to remind you of the requirements is not enough, it is inconsistent; and you can not always trust them. No student is perfect, people forget, and that is human nature; it feels like only a constant reminder will solve this problem.

Project Objectives:
- Provide a constant reminder to users through device notifications.
- Help with organisation of tasks/requirements by using an input and sorting them by date.
- Improve time management measured through amount of requirements/ tasks done before the deadline.

Planned Features:
- Calendar-type interface
- Notification system
- Light/Dark mode
- Daily to-do list
