Calendar for Requirements

Problem Statement:
Having to meet the demands of the curriculum these days isn't easy. Students struggle with the sheer amount of assignments and requirements that feel like they're being given every second. Relying solely on the people around you to remind you of the requirements isn't enough, its inconsistent; and you can't always trust them. No student is perfect, people forget, and that's human nature; it feels like only a constant reminder will solve this problem.
